## How to play
### There is only few ways to play:
* Play against bot (white or black)
* Player vs Player Mode

## Current Bugs
* Material Bar isn't working correctly, if player plays with black pieces
* Evaluation system isn't working correctly. It only functions correctly when AI player makes a move
* Responsivness of UI

## TODO
* Replace current UI system with UI Toolkit
* Replace parameters of making the board
* Play a Bot Settings (Difficulty Level)
* Material Panel functionality for both black and white players
* Multiplayer using PUN2 (Photon Unity Networking)
